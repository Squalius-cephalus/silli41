# Silli41

Silli41 is 41-key column staggered keyboard, heavily based on [REVIUNG41](https://github.com/gtips/reviung "REVIUNG41") design.

PCB is designed for MX style keyswitches, but it should support Choc V2 switches too. Current top plate only supports MX style switches. 5-pin switches is supported.

[QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmwarehttp:// "QMK") and [Vial](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk "Vial") firmwares has very barebones keymapping. Good for quick testing, but there is my current layout for Vial firmare. It is designed for a Finnish layout.
